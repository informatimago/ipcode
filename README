This is tested with:

- clisp 2.49+, compiled with new-clx;
- ccl 1.10.

With quicklisp
------------------------------

::

    ;; Until ipcode is included in quicklisp:
    (push #P"/path/to/ipcode/" asdf:*central-registry*)
    
    (ql:quickload "ipl")

    (in-package "IPL-USER")
    
    ;; Then try one of the following functions: 
    ;; some of them must be halted with Control-C;
    ;; in that case, exit from the debugger, reverting to the toplevel
    ;; with the :q command.
    (rotating-square) 
    (browning) 
    (test-draw-function) 
    (ex-turtle-1) 
    (ex-turtle-2) 
    (ex-turtle-3) 


Without quicklisp
------------------------------

To start with clisp, at the shell prompt type: ::

    ./lisp.sh

To start with ccl, at the shell prompt type: ::

    ccl -n -e '(load "ipl-init.lisp")' -e '(in-package "IPL-USER")'


To load the graphic examples: ::

    (load "ipl-ex-graphic")
    (in-package "IPL-USER")
    ;; then try one of the following functions: 
    ;; some of them must be halted with Control-C;
    ;; in that case, exit from the debugger, reverting to the toplevel
    ;; with the :q command.
    (rotating-square) 
    (browning) 
    (test-draw-function) 
    (ex-turtle-1) 
    (ex-turtle-2) 
    (ex-turtle-3) 


To exit, at the REPL prompt, type: 

    (quit)

Bugs
------------------------------

There's a new version of X11 that is incompatible with the current
version of CLX, and prevents it to connect:  ::

    Debug: Connection failure to X2816.0 server localhost display 0: Protocol version mismatch

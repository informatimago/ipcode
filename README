This is tested with:

- clisp 2.49+, compiled with new-clx;
- ccl 1.10.


To start with clisp, at the shell prompt type:

    ./lisp.sh

To start with ccl, at the shell prompt type:

    ccl -n -e '(load "ipl-init.lisp")' -e '(in-package "IPL-USER")'


To load the graphic examples:

    (load "ipl-ex-graphic")
    (in-package "IPL-USER")
    ;; then try one of the following functions: 
    ;; some of them must be halted with Control-C;
    ;; in that case, exit from the debugger, reverting to the toplevel
    ;; with the :q command.
